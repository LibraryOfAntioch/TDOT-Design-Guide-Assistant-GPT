# TDOT-Design-Guide-Assistant-GPT
A repository with the instructions and knowledge base behind the GPT.

This GPT was created to "Help users find guidance from the TDOT Roadway Design Guidelines, the Project Delivery Network, and the Project Scoping Guide"
This is solely for the state of Tennessee's department of transportation. 

Don't be a dummy, verify for yourselves what it says. You know, like how you're supposed to check your direct reports' work.... you are doing that already aren't you?

I've uploaded all the items needed to recreate this GPT anywhere. Feel free to use these instructions and knowledge base files for your own projects and improvements!

It is my hope that by sharing this GPT, which as already been useful to users, I can
1. Increase useres and user trust by showing transperency behind the GPT
2. Show the industry how simple GPTs can be incredibly useful
3. Help the industry move towards this next industrial revolution
